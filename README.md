# Angel on Xbox

Hi, I'm Jo, otherwise known as angelsk; and I play games

## SPECIAL: Extra Life 2019

This is the first year I'm doing Extra Life - and I've pledged to play games and raise funds for kids for the international program of a children's hospital in Toronto.

Tune in at 8am (UK time) on Saturday November 2nd 2019 to see me playing games for 24 hours solid for charity.

I have an approximate schedule for the day: **8am** - Zero Escape: The Nonary Games; **11am** - Chariot; **1pm** - We Were Here Too (co-stream); **4pm** - Cat Quest 2; **8pm** - Overcooked 2 (co-stream); **after midnight** - Afterparty. And we'll see how that goes...

Feel free to make a game suggestion when you donate.

I will be running a giveaway for **3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate** near the end of the stream, so let me know your Xbox gamertag when you donate to be entered for a chance to win :) (You get 1 entry per $10 donation)

If I hit my $500 goal, I will run a **second giveaway** for another 3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate

I will also run a game giveaway during the stream - you just need to be following to enter that one

## Mixer Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and generally at some time most weekends; check my stream status for the next slot (and game). 

I'm a huge fan of the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click or Puzzle games) - and my Mass Effect 2 Insanity Run.

Please follow and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my YouTube channel unedited (for posterity and laughs).
