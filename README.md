## #ExtraLife 2022

This is the <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk">4th year I'm doing **Extra Life**</a> - and I've pledged to play games and raise funds for kids for the international program of a children's hospital in Toronto.	

Tune in at 10pm (UK time) on **Friday November 4th 2022** to see me playing games for 24 hours solid for charity.	

I do not yet have an approximate schedule for the day, but you can make suggestions on my <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk">donation page</a>.

## Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and at 3pm (UK time) times at the weekends; check my stream schedule on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/angelsk_jo) for the next slot. 

I'm a huge fan of the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click, Visual Novel or Puzzle games).

I do a regular "Storytime with Jo" segement as part of my streams in a week, where I do voice overs for games that don't have them.  [Catch up with them on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FesQWXTZRwc&list=PL6RlkpVAiVLUZ7hMrjzQRWCLSrwGrkRCz&ab_channel=JoCarter
).

Please follow/ subscribe and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoCarterAngelSK) unedited (for posterity and laughs).
