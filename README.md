## #ExtraLife 2020

This is the <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk">third year I'm doing **Extra Life**</a> - and I've pledged to play games and raise funds for kids for the international program of a children's hospital in Toronto.	

Tune in at 10pm (UK time) on **Friday November 5th 2021** to see me playing games for 24 hours solid for charity.	

I have an approximate schedule for the day, which you can see on my <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk">donation page</a>.

Feel free to make a game suggestion when you donate.	

I am hoping to run some game giveaways during the stream - you just need to be following to enter those

## Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and at different times at the weekends; check my stream schedule for the next slot (and game). 

I'm a huge fan of the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click or Puzzle games).

Please follow and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my YouTube channel unedited (for posterity and laughs).
