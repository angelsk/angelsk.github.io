This is the second year I'm doing Extra Life - and I've pledged to play games and raise funds for kids for the international program of a children's hospital in Toronto.	

Tune in at 8am (UK time) on Saturday November 7th 2020 to see me playing games for 24 hours solid for charity.	

I have an approximate schedule for the day: TO BE DECIDED, including **8pm** - Overcooked 2 (multiplayer); **at some point** Day of the Tentacle.

Feel free to make a game suggestion when you donate.	

I am hoping to run some game giveaways during the stream - you just need to be following to enter those

## Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and generally at some time most weekends; check my stream status for the next slot (and game). 

I'm a huge fan of the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click or Puzzle games).

Please follow and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my YouTube channel unedited (for posterity and laughs).
