## Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and generally at some time most weekends; check my stream status for the next slot (and game). 

I'm a huge fan of the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click or Puzzle games).

Please follow and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my YouTube channel unedited (for posterity and laughs).
