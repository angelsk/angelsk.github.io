# Angel on Xbox

Hi, I'm Jo, otherwise known as angelsk; and I play games.  I'm a variety streamer that likes doing voice overs; and am a big fan of cats, stories and interesting mechanics in games.  I'm an ID@Xbox moderator so am often found #JoCasing ID@Xbox indie games on my channel.

## #ExtraLife 2025

This is the [7th year I've done **Extra Life**](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk) - and I've pledged to play games and raise funds for kids for the international program of the SickKids Foundation in Toronto. I've raised $13,275 in the previous 6 years for charity, and will be raising more in the future.

I'm playing games for 24 hours solid from 10pm (UK time) on **Friday November 7th 2025** for charity ([stream time in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Extra+Life+2025+-+angelsk_Jo&iso=20251107T22&p1=136&ah=23&am=59)).	

You can donate at any time until the end of the year on my [donation page](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk).

## Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and at 3pm (UK time) times at the weekends; check my stream schedule on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/angelsk_jo) for the next slot. 

I'm a huge fan of (and a moderator for) the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click, Visual Novel or Puzzle games).

I do a regular "Storytime with Jo" segment as part of my streams in a week, where I do voice overs for games that don't have them. [Catch up with them on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RlkpVAiVLUZ7hMrjzQRWCLSrwGrkRCz).

Please follow/ subscribe and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@angelsk_Jo) unedited (for posterity and laughs).
