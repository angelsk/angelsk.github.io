## #ExtraLife 2022

This is the <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk">4th year I've done **Extra Life**</a> - and I've pledged to play games and raise funds for kids for the international program of the SickKids Foundation in Toronto.	

I played games for 24 hours solid from 10pm (UK time) on **Friday November 4th 2022** for charity (times in your timezone can be seen on my donation page).	

I will be doing a bit of a fundraiser on my birthday in December, but you can still donate until the end of the year on my <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/angelsk">donation page</a>.

## Streaming Schedule

I stream "regularly" on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm (UK time); and at 3pm (UK time) times at the weekends; check my stream schedule on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/angelsk_jo) for the next slot. 

I'm a huge fan of the ID@Xbox program, and regularly stream games from there - along with some staples (mainly Point and Click, Visual Novel or Puzzle games).

I do a regular "Storytime with Jo" segement as part of my streams in a week, where I do voice overs for games that don't have them. [Catch up with them on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RlkpVAiVLUZ7hMrjzQRWCLSrwGrkRCz).

Please follow/ subscribe and sign up to be notified when I go live :) (And thanks for watching).

### But I missed it?!

I upload all videos of my streams to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@angelsk_Jo) unedited (for posterity and laughs).
